# UNVANISHING
This mod adds a new enchantment obtainable through **end city treasure chests**! Sustaining!
---
## What does it do?
Any tool/armor that has this enchantment will be maintained after the player's death, but **decreasing durability** after respawn by a half. (Destruction of said tool can and WILL be immenient after enough deaths).

## Obtaining
In each end city treasure chest there will be a **10%** chance the Sustaining enchanted book to spawn.

---
### Notes:
- Customizing values will hopefully be added in later versions.
- Reservation of the slot number is still not implemented.
- Bugs may be present (since this is my first mod ever).
